# Agentic AI for ADA (Cardano) News & Price Analysis
This repository showcases a **minimal agentic AI** that:
1. Fetches current Cardano (ADA) prices from a public API.
2. Retrieves headlines (in this demo, static examples).
3. Performs sentiment analysis on the headlines using a Hugging Face sentiment model.
4. Produces a **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold** recommendation based on sentiment.

> **Important**: This code is for demonstration purposes only and is **not** financial advice.

---

## Features

- **Fetch Real-Time Prices**: Uses the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) to get the current market price of Cardano (ADA).  
- **Simple Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes headlines using the [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) model.  
- **Rule-Based Decision**: Provides a basic Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation based on an average sentiment threshold.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**  
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   A minimal `requirements.txt` could look like:
   ```txt
   requests
   numpy
   transformers
   torch
   ```

3. (Optional) To run Hugging Face sentiment analysis on the GPU, ensure you have a compatible GPU and appropriate CUDA drivers installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/agentic-ada-ai.git
   cd agentic-ada-ai
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the agent**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   (Assuming the main script in this repo is named `main.py`; adjust accordingly.)

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:  
   After installing dependencies, simply run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Output**:  
   - The script will print the current ADA price.  
   - It will analyze sentiment on the given headlines.  
   - Finally, it will print a recommendation (**BUY**, **SELL**, or **HOLD**).

Example console output might look like:

```
=== Fetching ADA Price ===
Current ADA Price (USD): 0.3182

=== Fetching News Headlines ===
 - Cardano Surges After Positive Development Updates
 - Experts Warn Of Possible Correction in Cardano
 - Major Financial Institution to Begin Holding ADA Reserves
 - Bearish Signals Emerge Despite Cardano's Strong Performance
 - Investors Show Growing Interest in Cardano's Future

=== Analyzing Sentiment ===
Average sentiment score: 0.3456

=== Making Decision ===
Final Recommendation: BUY
```

## Code Explanation

The core functions include:

1. **`fetch_ada_price()`**  
   - Calls the CoinGecko API to get ADAâ€™s price in USD.

2. **`fetch_news_headlines()`**  
   - Returns a static list of sample headlines (replace with actual news sources in production).

3. **`analyze_sentiment(headlines)`**  
   - Uses a Hugging Face pipeline to get a **POSITIVE** or **NEGATIVE** score for each headline.  
   - Converts these to numeric values and averages them.

4. **`make_decision(avg_sentiment, current_price)`**  
   - Applies a simple rule-based threshold to output **BUY**, **SELL**, or **HOLD**.

5. **`run_agentic_ai()`**  
   - Orchestrates the full process (fetch price -> fetch news -> analyze -> decide).

        current_price = data["cardano"]["usd"]
        return current_price
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching ADA price: {e}")
        return None

        scores.append(numeric_score)

    else:
        return "HOLD"

    if price is None:
        print("Could not fetch price. Exiting.")

    print("\n=== Fetching News Headlines ===")
    headlines = fetch_news_headlines()
    for hl in headlines:
        print(" -", hl)

    print("\n=== Analyzing Sentiment ===")

    print("\n=== Making Decision ===")
    decision = make_decision(avg_sentiment, price)
    print(f"Final Recommendation: {decision}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_agentic_ai()
